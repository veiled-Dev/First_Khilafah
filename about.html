                <h2>A Little Bit of History</h2>
                <p>The First Khilafah School was established because there was a need to fill a void. In Kokoro Abu, there was no standard school run by a Muslim with international curriculum and Islamic ideology.</p>
                
                <p>By August 2015, the school started the academic session at 12, Surulere Street, Kokoro Abu with just 5 pupils. The Director was Late Mrs Habeebah Saliu with Ms Shifau AbdulQadr and Mr Michael Ogunbiyi as the pioneer teachers.</p>
                
                <p>Started purely with passionate vision, AbdusSomad AbdulMalik was the first pupil to graduate in the 2018/2019 session.</p>
                
                <p>For the 2022/2023 session, TFKS presented 4 pupils for the State Common Entrance Examination.</p>
                
                <p>Presently, the school is located at <strong>10, Raji Olowolegbon Street, off Kokoro Abu Street, Sabo, Ikorodu, Lagos</strong> with Ms Marufah Olorunnisola as the Director.</p>

            <h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
            <p>Ours is a uniquely designed curriculum drawn from the British EYFS, Riyadus-Soliheen and NERDC Curricula for preschoolers. The primary education is a blend of the National curriculum of Nigeria, England, Finland, Islam as well as current trend in work needs.</p>
            
            <p>Quran and hadith memorisation as well all core topics have been infused such that learners do not miss out on anything in being prepared for their future endeavours of problem-solving in their immediate environment.</p>

This is his first year in TFKS as a Nursery class pupil and I can't be more proud of my caring and loving boy who now does stuff with his siblings. Unity is important in any family and I owe that orientation to TFKS. AlhamduliLlaah!"</p>
