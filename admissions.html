                    <p>As we owe it to our dedicated staff to pay them on time for their excellent job, we need our pupils' parents to understand that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prompt payment of fees aid implementation of plans</li>

                        <li>The standard payment is 80% on resumption and 20% before midterm tests</li>
                        <li>Pupils whose parents cannot fulfill this obligation are to be kept at home. We would hate to send them back in these dangerous times, neither would we love to isolate them in school</li>
                        <li>All educational items are to be purchased in school. Any unbranded items will be confiscated</li>
